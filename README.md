This is a game created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND SCORE.
If a player rolls a 1, all their ROUND SCORE gets lost. After that, it’s the next player’s turn.
The player can choose to HOLD, which means that their ROUND SCORE gets added to their GLOBAL SCORE. After that, it’s the next player’s turn.
The first player to reach 100 points or whichever threshold set by the players, wins the game.
